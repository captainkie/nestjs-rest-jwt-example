# nestjs-rest-jwt-example
This project was built with NestJS to test REST API &amp; JWT authentication, SFTP, queue, and storage data using MongoDB &amp; Redis."  I've capitalized "REST API" for consistency, added a comma after "queue" for better readability, and made "SFTP" and "JWT" all uppercase to match the convention of using acronyms in uppercase.
